Tips:
    If you get this message when the code is fired:
        Send-MailMessage : The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.5.1 Authentication Required.
    
    1. Please make sure your password is correct.
    2. You have to allow less secure apps to access your account
        Sign in with your google account.
        Go to My Account -> Sign-in & Security.
        Next to "Access for less secure apps," select Turn on.
